			<p>A worker rides out to the Floreana, one of six cargo ships that circulate throughout the Galapagos Archipelago.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_2.jpg"/>
			<p>Workers often work barefoot. They regularly wade in the surf to unload goods when the tide is too low to approach the concrete pier.</p>
			
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_3.jpg"/>
			<p>Cargo ships regularly carry 12,000 bottles of beer per week to Isabela Island. Each crate must be unloaded by hand, the bottles are saved and sent back intact to be re-filled on the mainland. </p>

			Blue-footed boobies dive in the waters around a barge of cargo tied at the Isabela dock. The birds hunt in groups, when a bird sees a school of small fish, it will signal to the other birds in its group with a distinctive call and they will dive and hunt in unison. Although ungainly on the land, the boobies are agile hunters underwater.

			<p>A worker unloads building supplies.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_6.jpg"/>
			<p>The materials for every building on the island are brought to Isabela on the cargo ship and unloaded by hand.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_7.jpg"/>
			<p>A group of workers shoves off for another trip out to the Floreana.  Isabela's dock is located in waters too shallow for the ship to enter the harbor. </p>
	    	</li>
		
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_8.jpg"/>
			<p>Workers work long hours in tropical heat to unload cargo. A typical load will take more than 20 hours to unload completely.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_9.jpg"/>
			<p>The cargo ships come once a week bringing everything people on the island need. This shipment included cement, children's bikes, furniture, DVDs and toilet paper.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_10.jpg"/>
			<p>The <i>Floreana's</i> home port is Guadaquil on mainland Equador. It is 242 feet long.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_11.jpg"/>
			<p>Workers unload goods in the surf when the tide is too low for the small vessels to approach the concrete dock. Trucks drive onto the beach to receive the shipments.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_12.jpg"/>
			<p>A van arriving on the island is a rare occasion. Vehicles on the island are closely regulated; a fixed number of vehicles is enforced. Whenever a new vehicle arrives, another must leave or be de-commissioned.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_13.jpg"/>
			<p>A higher tide means workers can unload a variety of goods at a small concrete dock adjacent to the dock at which tourists arrive. </p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_14.jpg"/>
			<p>A truck idles while being loaded with concrete for new buildings being constructed on Isabela. Typically, a local entrepreneur will own both a truck and a motorboat and charge for the service of carrying goods onto the island.</p>
	    	</li>
		<li>
			<img src="../css/images/Taylor_15.jpg"/>
			<p>Once the trucks are loaded with goods from the cargo ship, workers must unload the goods at a small holding facility where they will be distributed across the island.</p>

		Markup for SLIDE animation
		You need to add an extra container element for the overflow: hidden property on the slider
		
		Update your flexslider() function with the following properties:
		
		<script type="text/javascript">
			$(window).load(function() {
				$('.flexslider').flexslider({
				  animation: "slide",
				  controlsContainer: ".flexslider-container"
			  });
			});
		</script>
